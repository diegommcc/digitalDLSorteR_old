\title{Deconvolute bulk gene expression samples (bulk RNA-Seq) using a pre-trained
DigitalDLSorter model.}
\usage{
deconvDigitalDLSorter(
  data,
  model = "breast.generic",
  batch.size = 128,
  normalize = TRUE,
  simplify.set = NULL,
  simplify.majority = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{matrix} or a \code{data.frame} with bulk gene expression
of samples. Rows must be genes in symbol notation and columns must be
samples.}

\item{model}{Pre-trained DNN model to use for deconvoluting process. For the
moment, the available models are for RNA-Seq samples from breast cancer
(\code{'breast.chung.generic'} and \code{'breast.chung.specific'})
environment.}

\item{batch.size}{Number of samples loadad in-memory each time of
deconvolution process. If unspecified, \code{batch.size} will default to
128.}

\item{normalize}{Normalize data before deconvolution. \code{TRUE} by default.}

\item{simplify.set}{List specifying which cell types should be compressed
into a new label whose name will be the list name item. See examples for
details.}

\item{simplify.majority}{List specifying which cell types should be
compressed into the cell type with greater proportions in each sample.
Unlike \code{simplify.set}, it allows to maintain the complexity of the
results while compressing the information, because it is not created a new
label.}

\item{verbose}{Show informative messages during the execution.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with samples (\eqn{i}) as rows and cell types
  (\eqn{j}) as columns. Each entry represents the predicted proportion of
  \eqn{j} cell type in \eqn{i} sample.
}
\description{
Deconvolute bulk gene expression samples (RNA-Seq) quantifying the proportion
of cell types present in a bulk sample. See in Details the available models.
This method uses a pre-trained Deep Neural Network model to enumerate and
quantify the cell types present in bulk RNA-Seq samples. For the moment, the
available models allow to deconvolute the immune infiltration breast cancer
(Chung et al., 2017) at two levels: specific cell types
(\code{'breast.chung.specific'}) and generic cell types
(\code{'breast.chung.generic'}). See \code{\link{breast.chung.generic}} and
\code{\link{breast.chung.specific}} documentation for details.
}
\details{
This function is oriented for users that only want to use the method for
deconvoluting their bulk RNA-Seq samples. For users that are building their
own model from scRNA-seq, see \code{\link{deconvDigitalDLSorterObj}}. The
former works with base classes, while the last uses \code{DigitalDLSorter}
objects.

For situations where there are cell types exclusive to each other because it
does not make sense that they appear together, see arguments
\code{simplify.set} and \code{simplify.majority}.

## simplify arguments
simplify <- list(Tumor = c("ER+", "HER2+", "ER+/HER2+", "TNBC"),

results2 <- deconvDigitalDLSorter(
  TCGA.breast.small,
  model = "breast.chung.specific",
  normalize = TRUE,
  simplify.set = simplify)

## in this case, the cell type with greatest proportion will be the new label
## the rest of proportion cell types will be added to the greatest
