\description{
DigitalDLSorter DNN model built and trained with single-cell data from Chung
et al., 2017 (GSE75688). This model allows the enumeration and quantification
of immune infiltrated cell types in breast cancer environment. This data set
consists in single-cell profiles from 11 patients from different tumor
etiology and stages (see Torroja and Sanchez-Cabo, 2019 for more details).
The analysis and characterization of cells was carried out by the authors of
\code{digitalDLSorteR} package.
}
\details{
The cell types considered in this model are 13, four of them being the
intrinsic molecular subtypes of breast cancer: ER+, HER2+, ER+/HER2+, TNBC,
Stromal, Monocyte, TCD4mem (memory CD4+ T cells), BGC (germinal center B
cells), Bmem (memory B cells), DC (dendritic cells), Macrophage, TCD8 (CD8+ T
cells) and TCD4reg (regulatory CD4+ T cells).

The genes considered are 23.260 in Symbol notation.

The model consists in 2 hidden layers with 200 neurons per layer trained with
'kullback_leibler_divergence' loss function  batch size equal to 128 and a
number of epochs equal to 25.
