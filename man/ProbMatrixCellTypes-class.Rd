\title{The Class ProbMatrixCellTypes.}
\description{
The ProbMatrixCellTypes class is a data storage class that stores
information concerning to cell composition matrix used for the simulation
of bulk samples. This matrix corresponds
with \code{prob.matrix} slot. The rest of slots are additional
information generated during the process and required for subsequent steps.
}
\details{
As described in Torroja and Sanchez-Cabo, 2019,
the proportions are built by five different methods in order to avoid biases
due to the composition of the bulk samples. In \code{plots} slot,
different representations of these probabilities are stored
with the aim of offering a method to monitor
the different sets of samples generated during the process. These plots can
be displayed with \code{\link{showProbPlot}} function. See documentation for
details.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{prob.matrix}}{Matrix of cell proportions generated for the simulation of
bulk samples. Rows correspond with bulk samples which will be generated (\eqn{i}),
columns are the cell types present in single-cell data provided (\eqn{j}) and
each entry is the proportion of \eqn{j} cell type in \eqn{i} sample.}

\item{\code{cell.names}}{Matrix in which names of cells that will compound each
bulk samples are stored.}

\item{\code{set.list}}{List of cells ordered according to the cell type to which they
belong.}

\item{\code{set}}{Vector with the names of cells present in the object.}

\item{\code{exclusive.types}}{Optional slot that contains the exclusive cell types
on the experiment if they are provided. NULL by default.}

\item{\code{plots}}{List of lists with plots showing the distribution of cell
proportions generated by each method during the process.}

\item{\code{type.data}}{Character with the type of data contained: training or test.}
