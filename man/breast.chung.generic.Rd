\description{
DigitalDLSorter DNN model built and trained with single-cell data
from Chung et al., 2017 (GSE75688). This model allows the enumeration and
quantification of immune infiltrated cell types in breast cancer environment.
This dataset consists in single-cell profiles from 11 patients from different
tumor etiology and stages (see Torroja and Sanchez-Cabo, 2019 for more details).
The analysis and characterization of the cells was carried out by the authors
of \code{digitalDLSorteR} package.
}
\details{
The cell types considered in this model are 7. They are the generic groups
from cell types considered in specific version. The cell types are B cells,
T CD4+ cells, T CD8+ cells, monocytes, dendritic cells, stromal cells and
tumor cells.

The genes considered are 23.260 in SYMBOL notation.

The model consists in 2 hidden layers with 200 neurons per layer trained with
'kullback_leibler_divergence' loss function  batch size equal to 128 and
a number of epochs equal to 25.
