\usage{
saveRDS(
  object,
  file,
  ascii = FALSE,
  version = NULL,
  compress = TRUE,
  refhook = NULL
)
}
\description{
Save \code{DigitalDLSorter} and \code{DigitalDLSorterDNN} objects as RDS files.
We developed this generic with the aim of changing the behavior of the base
function and saving the structure and weights of DNN model as R native objects.
This is because \code{keras} models are not able to be stored natively as R objects
(e.g. RData or RDS files). By saving the structure as JSON character object and
weights as list object, it is possible recovering the model and carrying
out predictions. If \code{trained.model} slot is empty, the function will have
the usual behavior.
}
\details{
With this option, the state of optimizer is not saved, only architecture and
weights. It is possible to save completely the model as HDF5 file with
\code{\link{saveTrainedModelAsH5}} function and to load into \code{DigitalDLSorter}
object with \code{\link{loadTrainedModelFromH5}} function.

Moreover, if you want to save the object as RDA file, it is possible
by converting the model to an allowed R object with \code{\link{preparingToSave}}
function.
